# cert extraction (2048-bit RSA, minimal DN -> 746-byte DER, comfortably
# under CERT_MAX_LENGTH).

# /product/app/<Module>/<Module>.apk doesn't encode the package name in its
# path (no "<pkg>-<hash>" segment for crown_manager()'s path parsing to find),
# so it needs the real package name given explicitly -- see the
# get_pkg_from_apk_path fallback in kernel/manager/throne_tracker.c. Requires
# the submodule (KernelSU-Next) to be at or past 893fb52d: fb4a650f runs a
# manager scan at init for non-late-load kernels, c969b344 adds the fallback
# that consumes this variable, and 893fb52d skips a pre-filter that would
# otherwise reject every /product/app candidate outright once this variable
# is defined. Verified 2026-09-03: fixes both "Unsupported" and "cannot load
# module zip" for our /product-baked manager, no boot regression (confirmed
# via a per-commit mini-bisect after an earlier report of a hang -- the hang
# did not reproduce on retest, consistent with the known pervasive
# intermittent boot issue, not this fix).
